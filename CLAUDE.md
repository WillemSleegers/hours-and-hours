# Development Guidelines

## Code Cleanliness

Always maintain clean code by removing unused components, functions, and imports when they are no longer needed. When refactoring or moving functionality:

1. Remove the original implementation files if they're completely replaced
2. Remove unused imports from all files
3. Delete unused utility functions, hooks, or components
4. Keep the codebase minimal and intentional

This ensures the codebase remains maintainable and easy to understand.
